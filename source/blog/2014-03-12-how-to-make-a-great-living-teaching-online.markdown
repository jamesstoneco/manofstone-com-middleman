I recently picked up this book and read it over a short trip to Armenia. I was pleasantly surprised with a very personal tour de force explanation of how he became an accidental entrepreneur of sorts and how this evolved into his current online business, [caveofprogramming.com](http://caveofprogramming.com). 

SPLIT\_SUMMARY\_BEFORE\_THIS

What I really like about this ebook over others, is that John has an active business and he describes exactly what his strategies are. He explains how to effectively teach something that is somewhat marketable, in his case programming, and to make money with it. He tells you how to get started, even if webcasting and video are not your forte, and how to test the waters in your area. 

He advises to start with about 3 videos and see if people start watching them. He also gives a lot of hope in explaining, it doesn't take that much traffic to make a few sales of a premium product.

Where many books and people giving advice in this area may encourage you to work on it full time, full commitment and eventually reap the rewards, John's advice is a bit more open minded and flexible, which is very refreshing.

He even points out that he is often lazy or has very low energy levels and admits that at some times he gets very little done towards his business.

One of the biggest things that I appreciate about the book is how genuine it is. I feel as if he was excited about his journey and just wanted to share his insight and experience with the world.

The book really focuses on what he does for a living. He sells premium courses through Udemy (who recently revised their royalty split) and promotes them through free courses on Udemy, YouTube and and his website/blog. If you follow what I am doing, you can see that is very similar to what I have been doing recently. With the exception of the Udemy courses.

I have been interested in putting together a premium Udemy course for quite some time but just haven't spent the time to figure out exactly how it all works. I taught at Penn State and it was a great experience. I have wanted to go beyond the basic blog articles and short screencasts on YouTube and I believe he presents a very good model to follow.

Can you use his methods with a different platform? Absolutely. He gives a good pitch about how Udemy is the premier marketplace at the moment, however, you do not sign an exclusive agreement with them. This allows you to also offer your courses through other e-learning platforms.

Also, you can release some of your lessons for free, as a way for people to try out the course, as well as release those same videos on YouTube to promote the course. This way you get the best of both marketing platforms. The number 1 e-learning platform coupled with the number 2 search engine in the world, that is owned by google, and is the number 1 video search engine, namely YouTube.

Another interesting thing to note is that there are a couple of diversions that I have to admit, almost lost me. But, if you hang in there, there is a great payoff. These are stories about his bouts of pot smoking as well as a public speaker that talks about magic mushrooms. These are some pretty bizarre stories that really seem out of left field, however, he brings it back to earth and remarkably relates it to the subject at hand, making and selling video courses online.

I found it to be a good quick read and well worth the low cost of entry. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to teach online in any sort of discipline. It is focused on programming tutorials, so if you are doing that sort of thing, as I am, you will find it particularly useful.
